# Child Story – A Short Emotional Social Awareness Project

This project tells a heart-touching story of a hungry child and the power of kindness from ordinary people.

## 📖 Story Overview

The story follows a young boy who is hungry and dreams of eating a piece of bread.  
He visits a small bakery but does not have money to buy food.

At first, the shopkeeper asks for payment, and the child feels sad and helpless.
